# 🧵 ClotheStore – OOP Concepts Demo

This is a small project designed to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles using a clothing store as the domain.

## 📚 Concepts Implemented

- 🧱 **Abstraction** – Abstract base classes define common behavior for all product types.
- 🧬 **Inheritance** – Specialized clothing items inherit from a general product class.
- 🔐 **Encapsulation** – Properties are managed through getters/setters to protect data.
- 🧠 **Polymorphism** – Unified method interfaces for different product types.

## 🧩 Structure Overview

- Product (abstract base class)
- Shirt, Jeans, Jacket (concrete subclasses)
- Customer and Order classes for interaction logic
- Use of overridden methods and interface-based design

## 🛠 Technologies

- Language: C#
- IDE: IntelliJ / Visual Studio

## 🚀 How to Run

Just open the project in your IDE and run the Main class to simulate store operations.

## 🎯 Learning Goal

Understand and apply core OOP principles in a simple, real-world inspired project.
